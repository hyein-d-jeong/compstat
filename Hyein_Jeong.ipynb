    "**Abstract** This study examines the performance of parametric and non-parametric methods. Logistic regression is used as an example of parametric methods and random forest is selected as a non-parametric model for classification. The performance of each model is evaluated by three measurement: False Positive Rate, True Positive Rate and Area Under the ROC Curve. The simulation data is manipulated to produce 8 different test sample. Across samples, logistic regression outperformed random forest. As increase the number of sample size, the performance gap measured by FPR decreased. AUC shows dominant performance of logistic regression more obviously. The largest AUC values of random forest was smaller than least AUC value of logistic model. It might suggest that the well-known disadvantage of random forest which is not suitable for data satisfying parametric test."

    "In economic research, regression is the most commonly used method to understand the relationship between independent variables and dependent variable. Regression enables to see counterfactual situations and helps to calculate the substantial impact of a variables of interest on a social phenomenon. However, its credibility is depending on whether the assumption on the distribution of independent variables are satisfied. This characteristics underlies across parametric methods. To complement this limitation, non parametric method is postulated which does not assume distributions of each variables. Nevertheless, it becomes less powerful when the parametric test is valid, and it makes difficult to say which method is powerful than the others. Therefore, this paper will examine the performance of parametric and non parametric method with several samples.\n",
    "\n",
    "The simulation data set comes from Bogan and Fernandez (2017). The original paper studied the impact of children with mental disability on household's investment decision. The investment decision was represented by a binary variable of 1 if the household has a certain type of asset. As a main analysis method, ***Logistic Regression*** was used. Of non parametric methods, this paper selected ***Random Forest*** to compare classification performance with logistic model. Random forest is a tree based model. A regression tree selects the most efficient split point in order and as repeats the splits, it reaches terminal node where there is no more split point. Random forest is a bundle of such regression trees. Based on bootstrap sample which allows sampling of replacement, the outcome of random forest is calculated by average of outcome of trees.\n",
    "\n",
    "The evaluation was conducted based on simulation data set up according to the data of the original paper(*Bogan and Fernandez, 2017*) and the simulation data is used to produce 8 samples. The first group is baseline sample which is 70% of observations of simulation data. The second group is samples with different number of explanatory variables by their importance. The importance of variable is determined by mean decrease in Gini coefficient indicating how each variable contributes to the homogeneity of nodes and leaves in the random forest. The third group includes three samples with different sample size. Lastly, in the fourth group, there are two samples with new dummy variables of risk preference and of these two sample, the last sample went through removal of explanatory variables by their importance.\n",
    "\n",
    "The measurement tool of performance referred to a paper which compared logistic regression and random forest(Kirasich and et al.,2018). There are three values were used to evaluate performance of each method. The first one is False Positive Rate(FPR) which is the portion of being *positive* in spite of being actually *negative*. Secondly, True Positive Rate(TPR) which is known as sensitivity was used for the analysis. It shows the portion of being *positive* of actual *positive* observation. With y-axis of TPR and x-axis of FPR, a graph can be induced, called ROC curve. The last measurement tool is Area Under the Curve(AUC) which is the area underneath ROC curve. The higher AUC value means higher accuracy of the model."

    "The original paper (Bogan and Fernandez, 2017) used logistic regression to see the effects of children with mental disability on the households' investment decision which is indicated by a binary variable. In many previous studies, non parametric methods proved an improved predictive power compared to parametric methods(Hong et al., 2020). Therefore, the application of random forest for the data analyzed based on logistic regression is expected to show better prediction on household's investment decision depending on the children's mentality status. However, some says that there is a trade-off in choosing one between those methods. For example, while random forest might return high variability in prediction and low bias, logistic regression can result in higher bias with lower variability(Kirasich et al., 2018)."

    "To evaluate the performance of random forest classification, this paper selected three criteria: false positive rate, true positive rate and area under the curve. **False Positive Rate**(FPR) is defined as the portion of being incorrectly assigned as positive but actually negative. On the other hand, **True Positive Rate**(TPR) which is known as sensitivity, indicates the portion of being detected as positive when it is actually positive. The curve with y-axis of TPR and x-axis of FPR is called **ROC curve** and the two-dimensional area underneath the entire ROC curve is defined as **Area Under the ROC curve**(AUC). The higher AUC means higher performance of a model because it means TPR of the model which means the ratio of conducting correct classification is more frequent than incorrect classification(FPR)."

In detail, logistic regression has smaller case of incorrect classification and shows remarkably better performance in correct classification than random forest.\n",

    "The second group is the sample with adjustment in explanatory variables. According to the level of mean decrease in Gini Coefficient, the first sample in this group removed 5 explanatory varibles:*WTRINHERITANCE, fourormorechild, healthins, finance* and *manager*. *WTRINTERITANCE* is a dummy variable of 1 if the household has received an inheritance; *fourormorechild* is also a dummy variable of 1 if the household has four or more children; *healthins* indicates if the household has health insurance; *finance* is 1 if the household is employed in the financial sector; *manager* is 1 if the household is employed in a managerial position and zero otherwise. In the second sample in this group, four more explanatory variables are removed, which are, *regionN, unemphd, onechild* and *threechild*. *RegionN* is a proxy for the household locating in North region and *unemphd* is 1 if the household is unemployed. The result in Figure 3 shows that logistic regression showed better performance across the both samples. However, as the explanatory variables are removed, the difference in performance measurement decreased, in particularly, FPR value in the second sample returns similar value.\n",

    "The third group consists of the samples with different sample size. FPR values were remained between 0.4 to 0.6 across samples and models and logistic model shows lower FPR over the samples which means it reached superior performance. Regaring to TPR, while resultant mean value of random forest model remained between 0.3 to 0.5, logistic model caused outcome between 0.5 to 0.6 which dominated random forest model.

On the other hand, the lowest AUC was found in **Explanatory Sample 1** whose AUC is approximately 0.452. Group 2 suggest that how the performance changes according to the sample size.

    "This paper has its value in comparing the classification performance of two different methods: random forest and logistic regression. The measurement tools are FPR, TPR and AUC. The main analysis was conducted over 8 different samples with changes in the number of explanatory variables, sample size and addition of new variables.Across the sample sets, performance of logistic regression dominated performance of random forest regarding to both FPR and TPR. Removal of less important explanatory variables and increase in the number of sample size reduced performance gap between two models.\n",
    "\n",
    "ROC curve has TPR as y-axis and FPR as x-axis like Figure 6 and the 45 degree line is where TPR = FPR. Therefore, if a ROC curve has more points where TPR is greater than FPR, the AUC value becomes greater. While the largest auc of random forest is 0.502 of Explanatory Sample 2 in Group 2 at Table 3, the least auc of logistic regression model is 0.571 in Large Sample in Group 3 at Table 3. It implies that logistic regression performs better than random forest regardless of sample set.\n",
    "\n",
    "This study might suggest the well-know disadvantage of non parametric model which is not suitable for data where parametric test is valid. There is possibility that random forest cannot outperform logistic regression because each variable satisfies assumed distribution. If so, it postulates that the performance gap with panel data might be greater than the one measured in this study. This study used a static sample with year$= 1999$ of panel data to control disadvantage on random forest due to dynamics. Therefore, this is open question that performance of the two models in panel data."
